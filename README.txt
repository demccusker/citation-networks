This project is a place to show off the agent-based model I created as part of my dissertation (before I knew how to use version control,
which is too bad because I have approximately 35 versions of it, all using poor naming conventions and many changes that should've been
done on branches). I also want to work on recreating the model in Python. 
The original version of the model was coded in NetLogo, which as the name suggests, is a Logo language. NetLogo is great for building agent
based models, but is otherwise a fairly limited language. It, for example, does not have while loops.
